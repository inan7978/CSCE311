	This is subproject 1. The program starts by having parent process open the file and read the contensts into a large string. This string is then passed over character by character using ASCII code (the buf was declared as an integer) to the child process. The child process recreates the string and sends it to a helper function. The program will at this point ask you for a keyword to search for AFTER it has finished passing the contents over to the child process. I am stating this becasue larger files will make the program appear to hang when it is really just loading the file. Once the keyword is entered, the results are instant. The helper function loads the string line by line and then word by word using ' ' as the delimiter. This is done with streams and the getline() function. After the lines with the word discovered are populated into the vector "values", they are sorted in decending order with a standard integer sort. I am not sure how this works, but my theory is that string is an array of characters which are really just ASCII code. And based on this the program sorts them. This is most notable by it separating lowercase letters from thier upper case counter parts. Once this is done the string "result" is cleared and loaded with the contents of the vector and returned where the child once again send it over character by character to the parent which ultimately outputs the string. I used for loops for the read() and write() functions and the loop limit was determined by the integer read from the first read()/write() above it. The limit is basically the size of the large string/result string. What an interesting project to figure out but im glad I did becasue the code I used appeard in a coding interview round. To run the program simply type "make" and press enter. The makefile will compile and run the program. To clean just type "make clean".

	The time it takes program to load the file is ultimately in linear proportion to the size of the file. The 6.5M file took about 15 minutes to load and once the word was entered the program had the lines found, saved, and sorted instantly.
